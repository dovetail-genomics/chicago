\description{
Promoter Capture data to be used as a toy example to run all steps of Chicago. This data only incorporates read pairs
including both chromosomes 20 and 21 in order to minimize processing time and memory storage. Thus, this data set
includes all cis read pairs for these two chromosomes and all trans read pairs between them.

The package includes ChIP-seq data from the ENCODE consortium, also restricted to chr20 and chr21.
