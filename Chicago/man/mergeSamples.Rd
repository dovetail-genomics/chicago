\title{
Merge samples together.
}
\description{
Merge a number of \code{chicagoData} objects together, summarising their counts into a normalised value.
}
\usage{
mergeSamples(cdl, normalise = TRUE, NcolOut = "N",
      NcolNormPrefix = "NNorm", mergeMethod = c("weightedMean", "mean")[1])
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{cdl}{A \code{list} of \code{chicagoData} objects.}
  \item{normalise}{
If \code{TRUE}, use a normalisation procedure, specified by \code{mergeMethod}, to arrive at a normalised count. If \code{FALSE}, take the mean number of reads.
}
  \item{NcolOut}{
The column to store the normalised counts in.
}
  \item{NcolNormPrefix}{
Each sample gains a normalised count column, that begins with this prefix.
}
  \item{mergeMethod}{
If \code{mergeMethod == "weightedMean"}, then NcolOut is the weighted mean of the sample-wise counts adjusted by the samples' respective scaling factors \code{s_k}. If \code{mergeMethod == "normMean"}, then sample-specific counts are first normalised by dividing by s_k, and NcolOut is computed as the mean of these normalised counts.
