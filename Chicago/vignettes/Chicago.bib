  abstract = {The human genome encodes the blueprint of life, but the function of the vast majority of its nearly three billion bases is unknown. The Encyclopedia of {DNA} Elements {(ENCODE)} project has systematically mapped regions of transcription, transcription factor association, chromatin structure and histone modification. These data enabled us to assign biochemical functions for 80\% of the genome, in particular outside of the well-studied protein-coding regions. Many discovered candidate regulatory elements are physically associated with one another and with expressed genes, providing new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation. The newly identified elements also show a statistical correspondence to sequence variants linked to human disease, and can thereby guide interpretation of this variation. Overall, the project provides new insights into the organization and regulation of our genes and genome, and is an expansive resource of functional annotations for biomedical research.},

	abstract = {Capture Hi-C (CHi-C) is a state-of-the art method for profiling chromosomal interactions involving targeted regions of interest (such as gene promoters) globally and at high resolution. Signal detection in CHi-C data involves a number of statistical challenges that are not observed with other Hi-C-like techniques. We present a noise model and algorithms for background correction and multiple testing that are specifically adapted to CHi-C data. We implement these procedures in CHiCAGO (http://regulatorygenomicsgroup.org/chicago), an open-source package for robust interaction detection in CHi-C. We validate CHiCAGO by showing that promoter-interacting regions detected with it are enriched for regulatory features and disease-associated SNPs.},
