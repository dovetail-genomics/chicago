## Introduction

This vignette will walk you through a typical CHiCAGO analysis.

We provide a wrapper to perform the analysis, called *runChicago.R*.

## Input files required

Before you start, you will need: 

1. Five restriction map information files. It is easiest to put all of these files in the same directory. If you are using a standard restriction enzyme and bait map, you can use the files on our website, otherwise you will need to generate them yourself.

    * Restriction map file (.rmap) - a bed file containing co-ordinates of the restriction fragments. By default, 4 columns: chr, start, end, fragmentID.
    * Bait map file (.baitmap) - a bed file containing co-ordinates of the baited restriction fragments, and their associated annotations. By default, 5 columns: chr, start, end, fragmentID, geneName.
    * *nperbin* file (.npb), *nbaitsperbin* file (.nbpb), proxOEfile (.poe) - Precompute these tables from the .rmap and .baitmap files, using the Python scripts *countNperBin.py*, *countNbaitsPerBin.py* and *getProxOE.py*. 

2. You will also need your input data, whose files end with *_distSign.txt*. These files can be obtained by running ...?

Examples of these files are given in the extdata folder, as follows...

```{r}
dataPath <- system.file("extdata", package="Chicago")
dir(dataPath)
```

## Example workflow

We apply CHiCAGO to the test data as follows. First, we create a blank ``ChicagoData`` object, 

```{r}
library(Chicago)
##FIXME
# cd <- setExperiment()
```

...

Discussed more in [The ChicagoData object](#link).

## Output

Describe each key plot in turn

```{r}
#FIXME
```
## Peak enrichment for features

``peakEnrichment4Features()`` tests the hypothesis that other ends in the CHiCAGO output are enriched for genomic features of interest - for example, histone marks associated with enhancers. You will need additional files to perform this analysis - namely, a .bed file for each feature:

```{r}
#FIXME
```

## The ChicagoData object {#cd}

In the above workflow, *cd* is a *ChicagoData* object. It contains three elements:

* ``cd@x`` is a `r CRANpkg("data.table")` (note: not a *data.frame*) that contains information about fragment pairs.
* ``cd@settings`` is a list of settings, usually set with the setExperiment() function.
* ``cd@params`` is a list of parameters. This list is populated as the pipeline runs, and CHiCAGO estimates them in turn.

**WARNING:** Many functions in CHiCAGO update ``cd@x`` by reference, which means that ``cd@x`` can change even when you do not explicitly assign to it.
To avoid this behaviour, copy the *chicagoData* object first:

| cdCopy <- copy(cd)
| cdCopy <- FIXME(cdCopy)
| identical(cd, cdCopy)


##Session info

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```
