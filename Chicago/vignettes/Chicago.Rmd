# CHiCAGO vignette

## Introduction

This vignette will walk you through a typical CHiCAGO analysis...

We provide a wrapper to perform this analysis, called *runChicago.R*.

## Input files required

Before you start, you will need: 

1. Five restriction map information files. It is easiest to put all of these files in the same directory. If you are using a standard restriction enzyme and bait map, you can use the files on our website, otherwise you will need to generate them yourself.

  * Restriction map file (.rmap) - a bed file containing co-ordinates of the restriction fragments. By default, 4 columns: chr, start, end, fragmentID.
  * Bait map file (.baitmap) - a bed file containing co-ordinates of the baited restriction fragments, and their associated annotations. By default, 5 columns: chr, start, end, fragmentID, geneName.
  * *nperbin* file (.npb), *nbaitsperbin* file (.nbpb), proxOEfile (.poe) - Precompute these tables from the .rmap and .baitmap files, using the Python scripts *countNperBin.py*, *countNbaitsPerBin.py* and *getProxOE.py*. 

2. You will also need your input data, whose files end with *_distSign.txt*. These files can be obtained by running ...?

Examples of these files are given in the extdata folder, as follows...

## Example workflow

We apply CHiCAGO to the test data as follows:

...

**WARNING:** Many functions in CHiCAGO update by reference, which means that objects can change even when you do not explicitly assign to them.
To avoid this behaviour, copy the *chicagoData* object first:

y <- copy(x)
x <- FIXME(x)

##Output

Lots of plots...
