Chicago 1.1.5
-------------

The values of two default settings have changed:
tlb.minProxOEPerBin: 1,000 changed to 50,000
tlb.minProxB2BPerBin: 100 changed to 2,500

We made this change in response to a bugfix in .addTLB(). This bug inflated the number of trans-count bins (though the read counts in those bins were still calculated correctly). The new setting values have been chosen to ensure that results should change as little as possible from Chicago 1.1.4. If you were not intentionally altering these two settings, then you shouldn't notice any qualitative differences.

Many thanks to Thomas Sexton for bringing the bug to our attention and helping us fix it.
