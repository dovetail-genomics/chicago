**CHiCAGO: Capture HiC Analysis of Genomic Organisation** 

CHiCAGO is a set of tools for Capture HiC data analysis. CHiCAGO is presented in [this paper](http://www.genomebiology.com/2016/17/1/127): Cairns J* / Freire-Pritchett P*, Wingett SW, Várnai C, Dimond A, Plagnol V, Zerbino D, Schoenfelder S, Javierre B-M, Osborne C, Fraser P, Spivakov M. CHiCAGO: Robust Detection of DNA Looping Interactions in Capture Hi-C data. Genome Biology. 2016. 17:127. .


This repository contains the following files:

- The Chicago R package     
- The PCHiCdata R data package with small example Promoter Capture HiC datasets for mouse and human  
- chicagoTools: scripts for preparing input files, running Chicago and processing the output  

Please refer to the Chicago R package vignette and the chicagoTools README file for more information.

*Installation instructions*

1. Make sure that you have R version >= 3.1.2. chicagoTools requires some additional dependencies: bedtools, perl and python >= 2.7 need to be pre-installed and added to PATH, plus the R package ``argparser`` is required - install with the R code:

```{r}
install.packages("argparser")
```

2. Get the chicagoTools scripts by downloading the repository (downloads tab on left-hand menu). These scripts do not need to be installed further - see chicagoTools/README.md.

3. Install the R packages. An easy way to do this is by using functionality in devtools - run the following R code:
```{r}
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_bitbucket("chicagoTeam/Chicago", subdir="Chicago")
```
Optionally, install the PCHiCdata package at the same time:
```{r}
install_bitbucket("chicagoTeam/Chicago", subdir="PCHiCdata")
```
(This strategy downloads the repository multiple times. To avoid this, you can manually install Chicago's dependencies, then install the packages from the source directories using ``R CMD INSTALL`` or ``install.packages()``.)

The R packages are also part of Bioconductor 3.3, and installation using ```biocLite()``` is available. However, as Bioconductor releases only happen twice a year, more recent versions of the R packages may be available from here.

If you encounter any problems, please [post an issue](https://bitbucket.org/chicagoTeam/chicago/issues) or email the developers. In the email, include output from the R command ``sessionInfo()``, along with any error messages encountered.
