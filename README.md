This is the repo for the second version of CHiCAGO peak calling pipeline. Currently it's still under development, so there are no docs for it yet. We'll update the readme once CHiCAGOv2 is ready for release.

Eventually the aim is for the branch structure to be as: http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/. Currently, we are using the master branch & feature branches only. Upon the first release, a development branch will be added.

Developers: Mikhail Spivakov, Jonathan Cairns, Paula Freire Pritchett.
